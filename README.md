# RitoOS
This is my third OS, and is currently in development.


# Alpha build
This *IS* a alpha build!
Some things may *NOT* work, and some things *WILL* not work.

The update command, for sure, is messed up, and has some unknown
effects.

Please, do *NOT* use this build *UNLESS* you made a copy of your current system and just want a little look at some of the
up coming builds.

RitoOS is *NOT* responsible for any damages done to your system or files. We are also *NOT* responsible for any effects Alpha builds may have on any system.
